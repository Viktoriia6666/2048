JavaScript: The JavaScript programming language is used to interact with the HTML structure and implement the game logic. JavaScript is also used for event handling, keyboard key processing, and game updates.

DOM (Document Object Model): JavaScript employs DOM operations to access page elements and manipulate them.

Event Listeners: Used to add event handlers, such as mouse button clicks or keyboard key presses.

Conditional Statements and Loops: Used to control the flow of program execution, for example, checking for the presence of an empty cell or conditions for the game.

CSS Classes and Animations: Used for styling elements and creating animated effects.
